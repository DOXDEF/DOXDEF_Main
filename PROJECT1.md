      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

### 주제 : 파이썬으로 노노그램 만들기

* 노노그램이란?

X×Y 크기의 직사각형에 각각 적혀있는 숫자를 보고 숨어있는 숫자를 예측해서 지우고 그려나가면서 그림을 만들어가는 게임.

* 노노그램을 어떻게 만들것인가?

특정 색깔로 이미 색칠되어 표현된 노노그램을 준비한다. 색칠되어있는 칸을 레이블링 하여 배열에 값을 저장 후 가로와 세로로 구분하여 노노그램을 표현한다.

{ 예시 }

stats[i]는 위와 같이 정렬된다.

노노그램의 예시를 하나밖에 들지는 못했지만, 이번 프로젝트에서 적용한 노노그램의 경우 row와 column에서 규칙성을 알 수 있었다.

<img width="{80%}" src="{https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77396001/146916053-7823a1a2-fc3a-4f27-81fb-4ff0b596b365.png}"/>

row값은 초기값이 2이고 이후 33씩 증가하며, column값은 초기값이 1이고 이후 31씩 증가한다.
위와 같은 규칙을 이용하여 노노그램을 작성하는 알고리즘을 작성하였고 다음과 같은 결과가 도출되었다.

row<br/>
1 1 1<br/>
2 2<br/>
1 1<br/>
6<br/>
1 2<br/>
2 1<br/>
1 2 2<br/>
1 2 1<br/>
2 1 1<br/>
3 2<br/>
<br/>
column<br/>
0<br/>
1 4<br/>
6 2<br/>
1 1<br/>
1 2 1<br/>
4 3<br/>
1 2 1<br/>
1 4 1<br/>
3<br/>
0<br/>

원본과 비교했을 때 정확히 일치한다는 것을 알 수 있다.

### 전체 코드 확인하기 : https://github.com/DOXDEF/DOXDEF_Main/blob/main/NONOGRAM.ipynb

=====================================

* 결론 및 아쉬운 점

 1. 1개의 예시에서 도출된 row와 column값이 다른 노노그램에도 적용된다는 점을 보장하기 어렵기 때문에 여러 개의 예시를 통해 노노그램 생성 알고리즘을 좀 더 보완해야할 필요가 느껴진다.
 2. column값을 생성하는데 stats 배열을 정렬해야하는 귀찮음이 동반되었다. 가로가 아닌 세로로 레이블링이 가능한지 알아봐야겠다.
 3. 일반적인 노노그램들은 주로 검은색으로 칠하기 마련이다. 검은색으로 실행시 오류가 나서 빨간색으로 칠한 노노그램에만 한정된 코드를 작성하였다. 검은색 뿐만아니라 다른 색에도 적용될 수 있는 범용적인 알고리즘을 만들 필요성을 느꼈다.
